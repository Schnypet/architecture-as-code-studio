3. Add UI controls in `ArchitectureDashboardComponent`
4. Update routing and navigation as needed

### Custom Styling

The application uses PrimeNG theming. To customize:

1. Update theme imports in `src/styles.css`
2. Override CSS custom properties for brand colors
3. Add component-specific styles as needed

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Follow Angular style guide and conventions
2. Write unit tests for new features
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Use conventional commit messages
